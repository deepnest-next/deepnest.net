## Important Update: API Pricing

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
We are excited to announce a major change to our API! Starting immediately, the <a href="https://convert.deepnest.io" target="_blank" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: none;">convert.deepnest.io</a> API will become a paid service. The new subscription plan will cost â‚¬104 per month, ensuring premium access to all features and priority support.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
This change allows us to focus on delivering even better services and features for our valued users. We believe this is a step forward for the community and the future of Deepnest.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
For more details, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/deepnest-next/deepnest/issues/104" target="_blank" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: none;">GitHub announcement</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #777; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">Happy April Fools' Day!<br>From your deepnest-next team!</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
PS: We don't use convert.deepnest.io anymore, we have our own converter.</p>
