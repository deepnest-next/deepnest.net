## How to replace

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
Yesterday I was informed that the converter API of <a href="https://convert.deepnest.io" target="_blank\" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: none;">convert.deepnest.io</a> is no longer available. Since there were no changes after the usual up to 60 minutes. So I quickly put together an API for you. Actually I wasn't ready yet, but after 8 hours I could at least report a success for my tests and provide instructions on how you can overwrite the converter until the next update</p>
