  </h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Scope:</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to the websites <strong
      class="font-bold">deepnest.net</strong>, <strong class="font-bold">deepnest.org</strong>, <strong
      class="font-bold">deepnest.it</strong>, and <strong class="font-bold">deepnest.app</strong> (hereinafter
    collectively referred to as “websites”). Below, we inform you about the processing of personal data when using our
    websites.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Controller:</strong><br>
    Josef Fröhle<br>
    Breuelstr. 11<br>
    49565 Bramsche, Germany<br>
    Email: <a href="mailto:stuff@deepnest.net" class="text-sky-600 hover:text-sky-700 hover:underline dark:text-sky-400 dark:hover:text-sky-300">stuff@deepnest.net</a></p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">The controller (also: “we” or “us”) is the person or entity that determines the purposes and means of
    processing of personal data.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">No data collection during informational visits:</strong> When you visit
    our websites for informational purposes only, we do <strong class="font-bold">not collect any personal
      data</strong> from you (e.g., we do not use any contact forms, analytics, or tracking services that profile your
    behavior). We do not require you to provide personal information just to use our websites. In particular, we <strong
      class="font-bold">do not use cookies</strong> for analytics or advertising without consent, nor do we employ any
    forms to collect data. Only technical information that is automatically transmitted by your browser is processed to
    display the website – for example, your IP address, date and time of access, browser type, operating system, and the
    page requested. This information is processed solely to enable the site to be delivered to you and to ensure
    stability and security of our service. These technical data (server log files) are stored temporarily and are not
    combined with other data or used to identify you. We do not perform any personal analysis or profiling of your
    browsing behavior.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">No disclosure to third parties:</strong> We do not sell or otherwise
    transfer your personal data to unauthorized third parties. However, in order to operate these websites, we rely on
    certain service providers who process data on our behalf (described in detail below). Such parties act strictly
    under our instruction and pursuant to <strong class="font-bold">Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)</strong> as
    required by Art. 28 GDPR, ensuring your data is protected. Beyond these processors and the cases explicitly
    mentioned in this policy, your data will not be passed on to third parties unless we are required to do so by law or
    you have given your explicit consent.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Legal bases:</strong> We process personal data only in accordance with the
    lawful bases outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In practice, this means we only process your
    data if one of the following applies: (a) <strong class="font-bold">Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR):</strong> you have
    given clear consent for us to process the data for a specific purpose; (b) <strong class="font-bold">Contract
      (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):</strong> the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take
    pre-contractual steps at your request (for instance, when you actively use our services); (c) <strong
      class="font-bold">Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR):</strong> the processing is necessary for us to comply
    with a legal obligation; or (d) <strong class="font-bold">Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong> the
    processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), except where such
    interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Our legitimate interests include, for
    example, ensuring the security, functionality, and efficiency of our websites. In this Privacy Policy, we indicate
    the relevant legal basis for each specific processing activity where appropriate.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Storage period:</strong> We retain personal data only for as long as
    necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. Once the purpose no longer applies, we delete or
    anonymize the data in accordance with our data retention routines, provided there are no statutory retention
    requirements (such as commercial or tax record-keeping obligations) that require a longer storage. If you exercise
    your <strong class="font-bold">right to deletion</strong> or withdraw consent (where consent was the basis for
    processing), we will promptly erase the data concerning you, unless we have a different legal basis to continue
    processing (for example, a legal obligation to retain certain data). In cases where we must retain data due to legal
    obligations, the data will be blocked from routine use and deleted immediately after the retention period expires.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400">2. Contact via Email</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">Our websites do not include a contact form or other direct data entry forms. However, you can contact
    us via the email address provided. If you <strong class="font-bold">contact us by email</strong>, we will process
    the information you provide in your message – this typically includes your email address and the content of your
    inquiry, and any other personal data you include in the email (such as your name or a phone number in an email
    signature). We will use these details exclusively for the purpose of communicating with you and handling your
    request.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">Any data you send us in this context will be treated confidentially. We do <strong
      class="font-bold">not share</strong> your email or its content with third parties without your permission. The
    legal basis for processing your email inquiry depends on the nature of your request. If your email relates to
    entering into or performing a contract or using our services (for example, questions about the software or support
    requests), the processing of your data is necessary for the <strong class="font-bold">performance of a contract or
      pre-contractual measures</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR). In other cases, our processing is based on our <strong
      class="font-bold">legitimate interest</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in responding to your communication and
    maintaining user satisfaction, since you contacted us voluntarily with a question or comment. If you explicitly
    consent to a certain kind of processing in your email or we ask for your consent regarding further use of the data,
    then Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR serves as the legal basis (you may withdraw such consent at any time with future effect).</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">We will retain the data from your email inquiry only for as long as necessary to process your request
    and any follow-up questions. Once your inquiry is resolved and no further communication is needed, we will delete
    your correspondence. Mandatory statutory retention periods (for example, those under commercial or tax law for
    business correspondence) remain unaffected – meaning if your email must be retained for legal archiving purposes, it
    will be stored for the duration of the applicable period (typically up to 6 or 10 years in Germany for certain
    business communications). During any such retention, we will restrict processing of your email to storage and legal
    compliance only.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400">3. Data Processing via the Converter
    API</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">Our service provides a <strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">file
      conversion tool (Converter API)</strong> which allows users to submit certain files for conversion (for example,
    converting a DXF file as part of the Deepnest application’s functionality). When you utilize this converter service,
    data from the file you provide will be processed on our server to perform the conversion. We outline below how this
    processing occurs and what happens with your data:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-justify space-y-2">
    <li>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Submission and temporary storage:</strong> If you submit a file to our
        Converter API (either through our website or via the Deepnest application interfacing with our server), the file
        is received by our server and stored <strong>temporarily</strong> for the conversion process. We use the file
        data <strong>only</strong> to perform the conversion operation that you have requested. Once the conversion is
        completed, the resulting output (converted file or data) is returned to you (for example, transmitted back to
        the application or made available for download), and the file you originally uploaded is <strong>deleted from
          our server shortly thereafter</strong>. We do not keep your uploaded files on our server beyond the immediate
        requirements of processing your request. In other words, there is no permanent or long-term storage of the
        personal data contained in the files you provide, except possibly in the limited cases described below for
        debugging.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Sample data and error logs for troubleshooting:</strong> In rare
        cases, we may retain an <strong class="font-bold">anonymized sample</strong> of a submitted file or certain
        data from a processing request for the sole purpose of diagnosing and fixing technical issues with our Converter
        API. For instance, if a particular file consistently causes an error or the conversion fails, our team might
        save that file (or a portion of it) to reproduce the problem and improve our software. <strong>Importantly, any
          such retained sample files are stored without any personal identifiers and cannot be traced back to the user
          who submitted them.</strong> We do not keep information like email addresses, IP addresses, or any account
        info linked to the file – we typically only retain the file’s content itself and only if it’s necessary to debug
        a technical issue. These debug files or error logs are also kept only temporarily and are deleted as soon as the
        relevant problem is resolved or the data is no longer needed for analysis. They are never used for any purpose
        other than maintenance and improvement of the service.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">The processing of data through the Converter API is done to perform the service <strong
      class="font-bold">explicitly requested by you</strong> (i.e., the conversion of the file you submitted).
    Therefore, the primary legal basis for this processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, as it is necessary for the <strong
      class="font-bold">performance of a contract or a user-requested service</strong>. By choosing to use the
    converter, you are essentially requesting a technical service which we fulfill by processing your file. Insofar as
    we retain anonymized files or data for troubleshooting purposes, the legal basis is our <strong
      class="font-bold">legitimate interest</strong> pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in ensuring the reliability and
    improvement of our services. This legitimate interest is considered to not override your rights and freedoms since
    the data retained for debugging contains no information that can identify you personally. If you prefer that your
    data never be retained even for debugging, you have the option not to use the converter service. However, please
    rest assured that ordinarily your files are processed and deleted automatically without human intervention, and any
    exceptional retention for error analysis is both rare and stripped of personal identifiers.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400">4. Hosting and Website Infrastructure
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">We utilize external service providers to host our websites and deliver content efficiently and
    securely to users. In particular, our websites are served through the <strong class="font-bold">Content Delivery
      Network (CDN)</strong> of <em>Cloudflare</em> and are also stored on a server provided by an external hosting
    provider. We have entered into appropriate <strong class="font-bold">Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)</strong>
    with these providers to ensure your personal data is handled in compliance with data protection laws. Below we
    detail these services:</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-primary-500 dark:text-primary-400">Cloudflare CDN</h3>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">We use the CDN service <strong class="font-bold">Cloudflare</strong>, operated by Cloudflare, Inc.,
    101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“Cloudflare”). Cloudflare provides a globally distributed network of
    servers that deliver the content of our websites to you from a location near you, which improves load times and
    reliability. Additionally, Cloudflare offers security features that help protect our sites from malicious attacks
    (such as DDoS attacks) and unauthorized access.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Data processing through Cloudflare:</strong> Whenever you visit our
    websites, your browser’s requests are automatically routed through Cloudflare’s network. In this process, Cloudflare
    will inevitably receive certain technical data about your visit, including your <strong class="font-bold">IP
      address</strong>, the requested web resource, and some information about your browser and system. Cloudflare needs
    to process this data to deliver the content of the site to you and to perform its security functions (for example,
    distinguishing legitimate visitors from attackers). Cloudflare may use cookies or similar technologies on your
    device as part of its security and performance services. For instance, Cloudflare might set a cookie (such as a
    <strong class="font-bold">“__cfduid”</strong> or similar) to identify your device as trusted (this cookie is used
    for security purposes and does not track your activity beyond our site). Such Cloudflare cookies are classified as
    <strong class="font-bold">essential for the service</strong>, meaning they are required to maintain website
    security and functionality.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Transfer of data to third countries:</strong> Cloudflare, Inc. is a
    US-based company. Personal data (like IP addresses) that pass through Cloudflare’s network may be processed on
    servers outside the European Union (including in the USA). We have ensured adequate protection for such data
    transfers: Cloudflare is <strong class="font-bold">certified under the EU–US Data Privacy Framework
      (DPF)</strong>, which confirms that it upholds EU-equivalent data protection standards. In addition, we have
    signed Standard Contractual Clauses with Cloudflare as part of our DPA, obligating Cloudflare to protect European
    personal data. For more information on Cloudflare’s privacy practices, you can refer to Cloudflare’s privacy policy
    on their website.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Legal basis:</strong> We use Cloudflare’s services based on our <strong
      class="font-bold">legitimate interest</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in providing our website content in a <strong
      class="font-bold">secure</strong> and <strong class="font-bold">efficient</strong> manner. The improvement in
    loading speed and the enhanced protection against attacks benefit both us and the users of our site. These interests
    are not overridden by the relatively limited processing of personal data (primarily IP addresses for
    connectivity/security) by Cloudflare. Where Cloudflare sets essential cookies or performs security-related
    processing, this is also permitted under §25 (2) of the German TTDSG (which allows necessary cookies without
    consent). We do not use Cloudflare for any marketing or analysis purposes.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-primary-500 dark:text-primary-400">External Hosting Provider</h3>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">In addition to the CDN, our website’s data (the actual content, files, and database) is hosted on a
    server provided by an external hosting company <strong class="font-bold">in the European Union (Germany)</strong>.
    For performance and reliability reasons, we operate a dedicated server (or virtual server) with this provider, which
    we manage ourselves (“self-operated server”). This hosting provider acts as our <strong
      class="font-bold">processor</strong> under GDPR, meaning all personal data on the web server is handled
    according to our instructions and is protected by a DPA.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Data processing by the host:</strong> When you access our websites, the
    server of our hosting provider will process your requests and deliver content to your browser. In doing so, the
    server automatically records <strong class="font-bold">server log files</strong> containing certain data from your
    visit. These log files typically include your IP address, the date and time of access, the specific page or file
    requested, the amount of data transmitted, a success/failure status code, and possibly your browser type and
    operating system (through the User-Agent string). Such logging of connections is a standard security measure and
    helps in diagnosing technical issues. The log data may qualify as personal data (especially the IP address).
    However, we <strong class="font-bold">do not use</strong> these logs to identify individual visitors or to profile
    them. The log files are used solely for ensuring the stability and security of the server (for example, detecting
    misuse or intrusion attempts) and for troubleshooting technical problems. Under normal circumstances, these server
    logs are automatically <strong class="font-bold">deleted after a short period</strong> (typically within a few
    days up to a couple of weeks). We only retain logs longer if there is a specific reason to do so, such as
    investigating a security incident or fulfilling legal obligations.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">Our hosting provider is contractually bound to process personal data <strong class="font-bold">only
      for the purpose of hosting our website content and as instructed by us</strong>. The provider is not permitted to
    access or use your data for any other purposes. In the unlikely event of maintenance or support by the provider’s
    staff, any access to personal data would also be covered by confidentiality agreements.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Legal basis:</strong> The involvement of an external host is based on
    <strong class="font-bold">Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest)</strong>. It is our legitimate interest to
    utilize a professional third-party hosting service to ensure our websites remain <strong
      class="font-bold">operational, secure, and performant</strong>. By outsourcing hosting to a reputable provider,
    we benefit from their infrastructure and security measures, which in turn safeguards the data processed (including
    any personal data like IP addresses). This arrangement ultimately serves both our interest and the interest of our
    users in having a reliable and safe website experience. Additionally, to the extent that the hosting involves
    technically necessary storage of data on your device or access to such data (for example, storing essential cookies
    or caching content), it is permitted by law without consent as it is strictly needed for the service (§25 (2) TTDSG
    in Germany). We have ensured via the DPA that your data is protected and that any processing by the host is
    compliant with GDPR.</p>

<div class="mb-12 bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-900 p-6 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400">5. Consent Management Platform
    (CookieHub)</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">We use a <strong class="font-bold">consent management platform</strong> on our websites to manage
    cookies and similar technologies in compliance with data protection requirements. Specifically, we have integrated
    the <strong class="font-bold">CookieHub</strong> consent management tool, provided by CookieHub ehf., Hafnargata
    55, 230 Reykjanesbær, Iceland (“CookieHub”). This tool helps us inform you about cookies used on our sites and
    records your preferences regarding which categories of cookies you allow or reject.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">How CookieHub works:</strong> When you first visit our websites (or if you
    revisit after clearing cookies), CookieHub will display a cookie consent banner. This banner will inform you about
    the types of cookies we use and ask for your permission to set any cookies that are not strictly necessary. You can
    choose to <strong class="font-bold">accept</strong> or <strong class="font-bold">decline</strong> optional
    cookies (e.g., for analytics or personalization, if we ever employ such cookies). Your selection (consent or refusal
    for each category of cookies) will be saved by CookieHub. To remember your choice, CookieHub sets a special <strong
      class="font-bold">cookie on your browser</strong> (often named something like <code>cookiehub-consent</code> or
    similar). This cookie stores an ID or value that indicates what preferences you have given. When you revisit our
    site, CookieHub reads this cookie to automatically apply your preferences (so you won’t be asked again every time,
    unless preferences need to be renewed). The CookieHub consent cookie is considered <strong
      class="font-bold">necessary</strong> for compliance, as it stores the user’s decision; therefore, it may be set
    without requiring separate consent. It does not track you beyond remembering your settings.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Data transmitted to CookieHub:</strong> In the process of displaying the
    consent banner and recording your choice, your browser will connect to CookieHub’s servers (for example, to load the
    consent banner script and to send your preferences). Through this connection, CookieHub will process certain data,
    including your <strong class="font-bold">IP address</strong> (which is needed to serve your device), information
    about your browser and device (to ensure the banner is displayed correctly), and the information about your consent
    decision (which categories you accepted or declined, and the timestamp). CookieHub may store these data on its
    servers, which are generally located within the European Union (according to CookieHub, data is typically stored on
    servers in the Netherlands). CookieHub then provides us with an anonymized report or log of user consents. This log
    allows us to demonstrate, if needed, that users have given or refused consent for optional cookies, as required by
    law. The information stored in this log includes a randomized identifier for the consent event, the preferences
    given, and the time and date; it does not contain your name or email or similar personal identifiers, but an IP
    address might be considered personal data and is therefore protected.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">We have a <strong class="font-bold">Data Processing Agreement</strong> with CookieHub, ensuring that
    CookieHub only processes the data from our site visitors according to our instructions and in compliance with GDPR.
    CookieHub will not use the data for any purpose other than providing the consent management service for us.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Current cookie usage:</strong> As of now, our websites use <strong
      class="font-bold">only essential cookies</strong> necessary for basic functionality (including the CookieHub
    cookie itself and possibly Cloudflare security cookies as mentioned). We do <strong class="font-bold">not</strong>
    use any analytics, advertising, or tracking cookies that would require consent. Therefore, in practice, the
    CookieHub banner might simply inform you that only necessary cookies are in use. You may not be presented with
    multiple categories to opt in/out if there are no non-essential cookies to choose. However, we have implemented
    CookieHub to be prepared and compliant in case we introduce additional cookies or similar technologies in the
    future. If that happens, you will be clearly prompted via the CookieHub banner to give or withhold consent for those
    new cookie categories. You can also adjust your cookie preferences at any time (for example, by clicking a “Cookie
    Settings” link or icon on the website, which re-opens the consent dialog) and change your selection or withdraw
    consent.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify"><strong class="font-bold">Legal basis:</strong> Using CookieHub helps us fulfill our legal
    obligations under GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive (as implemented by national laws like the German TTDSG) to obtain
    user consent for non-essential cookies. The processing of data by CookieHub (and the setting of the CookieHub
    preference cookie) is necessary for compliance with these <strong class="font-bold">legal obligations</strong>
    (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR). In addition, it is in our <strong class="font-bold">legitimate interest</strong> (Art.
    6(1)(f) GDPR) to implement a user-friendly and transparent consent solution, both to ensure legal compliance and to
    give users control over their privacy choices. These interests align with those of our users, as CookieHub provides
    a clear mechanism for users to understand and control cookie usage. Since CookieHub is based in Iceland (which is
    part of the European Economic Area) and stores data within the EU, your data related to consent management does not
    leave the European jurisdiction, and is handled with appropriate protection.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400">6. Your Rights as a Data Subject</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-justify">Under the GDPR, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. We respect these rights and have
    implemented processes to enable you to exercise them. Below is a summary of your rights:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-justify space-y-3">
    <li>
      <p class="mb-1"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">Right of Access (Art. 15
          GDPR):</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not we are processing
        personal data concerning you. If we do, you can request access to the personal data and additional information
        such as the purposes of processing, the categories of data, the recipients (or categories of recipients) to whom
        your data have been or will be disclosed, and (if possible) the envisaged storage period. Upon request, we will
        provide you with a copy of the personal data undergoing processing, free of charge (for further copies, a
        reasonable fee may apply).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="mb-1"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">Right to Rectification (Art. 16
          GDPR):</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal data we hold about you
        without undue delay. You also have the right to have incomplete personal data completed – taking into account
        the purposes of the processing – for example by providing a supplementary statement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="mb-1"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">Right to Erasure (Art. 17
          GDPR):</strong> Also known as the “right to be forgotten,” this right entitles you to request the deletion of
        your personal data if certain grounds apply. These grounds include: the data are no longer necessary for the
        purposes they were collected or processed; you withdraw consent (if the processing was based on consent) and
        there is no other legal basis; you object to processing based on legitimate interests and there are no
        overriding legitimate grounds for us to continue; the data was processed unlawfully; or deletion is required to
        fulfill a legal obligation. Please note that this right is not absolute – if we are legally required to keep the
        data or if the data is needed for legal claims, we may not immediately erase it, but we will inform you
        accordingly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="mb-1"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">Right to Restriction of
          Processing (Art. 18 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your
        personal data in certain circumstances. “Restriction” means marking the data so that it will only be processed
        for specific limited purposes. You can obtain restriction if: you contest the accuracy of your data (for a
        period enabling us to verify it); the processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure and request restriction
        instead; we no longer need the data, but you need it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal
        claims; or you have objected to processing (see next bullet) and verification of our legitimate grounds is
        pending. When processing is restricted, we will store your data but not use it (other than, for example, to
        establish or defend legal claims, or with your consent).</p>

      <p class="mb-1"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">Right to Data Portability (Art.
          20 GDPR):</strong> Where we process personal data based on your consent or for the performance of a contract,
        and the processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive the personal data you
        provided to us in a <strong class="font-bold">structured, commonly used, machine-readable format</strong>. You
        also have the right to request that we transmit this data directly to another controller, where technically
        feasible. This right applies, for example, to data you provided for use of a service. It does not apply to data
        that we create (like internal analytics) or data processed on a legal basis other than consent or contract.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="mb-1"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">Right to Object (Art. 21
          GDPR):</strong> You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your <strong
          class="font-bold">particular situation</strong>, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you
        that is based on Art. 6(1)(e) GDPR (processing in the public interest or under official authority) or Art.
        6(1)(f) GDPR (processing based on legitimate interests). If you lodge an objection, we will no longer process
        your personal data for the relevant purposes unless we can demonstrate <strong class="font-bold">compelling
          legitimate grounds</strong> for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the
        processing is for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. <strong>Right to object to direct
          marketing:</strong> In addition, if we were to process your personal data for direct marketing purposes (which
        we currently do not), you would have the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data for
        such marketing. If you object to direct marketing, we will cease processing your data for those purposes
        immediately. (This includes profiling to the extent that it is related to direct marketing.)</p>

      <p class="mb-1"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">Right to Withdraw Consent (Art.
          7(3) GDPR):</strong> If you have given us consent to process your personal data, you have the right to <strong
          class="font-bold">withdraw your consent at any time</strong>. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the
        lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. For example, if you gave consent for cookies or
        newsletters, you can withdraw it, and we will stop the related processing going forward. Withdrawing consent is
        usually as easy as the act of giving it – for instance, you can adjust your cookie settings via our CookieHub
        banner or unsubscribe from a newsletter via the provided link, or simply contact us.</p>

      <p class="mb-1"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-300">Right to Lodge a Complaint
          (Art. 77 GDPR):</strong> If you believe that we are processing your personal data in violation of applicable
        data protection laws, you have the right to file a complaint with a <strong class="font-bold">data protection
          supervisory authority</strong>. You can do this in the EU Member State of your habitual residence, place of
        work, or the place of the alleged infringement. For example, if you reside in Germany, you may contact the Data
        Protection Authority (DPA) of the federal state you live in, or you can reach out to our lead supervisory
        authority in Germany. In Lower Saxony, where our company is based, the competent authority is the
        <em>Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz Niedersachsen</em> (State Data Protection Commissioner’s Office for
        Lower Saxony). Lodging a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies you
        might have.</p>

    your rights at any time by contacting us via the contact details provided at the beginning of this Privacy Policy
    (or as listed in the Imprint of our website). We will respond to your request without undue delay, and in any event
    within the timeframe required by law (generally within one month, extendable by two further months if necessary,
    depending on complexity). We may need to verify your identity to ensure that your personal data is not disclosed to

    excessive requests, in which case we might charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act (as permitted by law). We

    is important to us, and we will do our best to address any issues.</p>
